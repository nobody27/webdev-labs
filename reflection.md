## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete the exersizes with the help of the code repository and some google searches. I did not need to watch any videos or look at the solutions.

The exercises were simple but helpful. I don't feel like I could write a complex webpage since it mostly consisted of minor changes to existing elements, however it is a good first step in becoming familiar with the code, fileds, and options.

I was surprised to find that the buttons in 04-form that did not lead anywhere did not cause any WAVE errors.

I don't know enough to think of anything that could or should have been explained better or any exercises that might have helped. All in all, this is a good start, sepecially after the explanaitions during the lecture.
