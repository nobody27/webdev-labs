## Reflection Document

### HTML

I was able to complete the exersizes with the help of the code repository and some google searches. I did not need to watch any videos or look at the solutions.

The exercises were simple but helpful. I don't feel like I could write a complex webpage since it mostly consisted of minor changes to existing elements, however it is a good first step in becoming familiar with the code, fileds, and options.

I was surprised to find that the buttons in 04-form that did not lead anywhere did not cause any WAVE errors.

I don't know enough to think of anything that could or should have been explained better or any exercises that might have helped. All in all, this is a good start, sepecially after the explanaitions during the lecture.

### Accessibility

The issues were simple emough and I was able to modify code from the first section in order to fix the issues with radio buttons (without looking at the answers). I'm not sure how much the excersizes actually helped me learn, since they mostly focused on things we talked about in the first (HTML) section, but it's always good to go over things again.

### CSS

One thing I noticed was that it was difficult for me to discern between some different colors from the example picture. It might be helpful for the text to also indicate the color that it should appear as (or perhaps to have colors with more contrast between them).

I didn't look at the answers, though I did get stuck in a few places and had to google some questions to figure out what to do.

The WAVE review of the selectors page is not clean because of contrast errors, and the WAVE reviewes of the position and media quesries pages are not clean because of a lack of headers

### Flexbox and Grid

I was able to complete most of both of these labs during the lesson and it was very helpful as a way to understand the material and how it works. I did ask questions during the lesson and got helpful answers, but did not need to look at solutions.

The 02-grid-areas page doesn't pass WAVE because of a lack of headings.

### Bootstrap

I was able to complete most of the work based on the samples and what was shown in class, while also looking at the bootstrap example website. (In this case, I didn't even need to google very much). I will still need to see what can be done about a wave alert where WAVE expects the card titles to be h2 followed by h3, but that doesn't match the desired appearance.

For the modal, I got most of my info (includeing some copy and pasting) from the bootstrap documentation website.

The Cards page has some WAVE alerts because they expect headings to work differently.

### Javascript

This lab was very useful to me, especially learning about the existnace and usage of the different reduce/filture/map functions. I was able to complete the work without looking at the answers but I did use google a lot for help. While working on the event handlers, I hope I did the right thing by using javascript to add a second output section in which to show the input, better instructions would have been helpful.

The fetch page didn't pass wave because of an issue with headings that couldn't be fixed while fitting the desired design.

### Jquery

Jquery lab isn't required.
